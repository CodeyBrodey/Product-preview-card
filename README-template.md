## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Used this exercise to review and dust off HTML/CSS skills. Got stumped on some parts but was able to figure it out with some help from discord group.

### Continued development

Just better written code. Some minor parts felt that I was using some random numbers for the layout, which is ok but is more prone to cause error than other more solid parameters.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin PowellÂ´s Discord group] - Very helpful group with lots of different ways to get help.
